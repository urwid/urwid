Urwid 0.9.8.1
=============

2007-06-21

 * Fixed a Filler render() bug, a raw_display start()/stop() bug and a
   number of problems triggered by very small terminal window sizes.


Urwid 0.9.8
===========

2007-03-23

 * Rendering is now significantly faster.

 * New Widget base class for all widgets. It includes automatic caching
   of rows() and render() methods. It also adds a new __super attribute
   for accessing methods in superclasses.

   Widgets must now call self._invalidate() to notify the cache when
   their content has changed.

   To disable caching in a widget set the class variable no_cache to a
   list that includes the string "render".

 * Canvas classes have been reorganized: Canvas has been renamed to
   TextCanvas and Canvas is now the base class for all canvases. New
   canvas classes include BlankCanvas, SolidCanvas and CompositeCanvas.

 * External event loops may now be used with the raw_display module. The
   new methods get_input_descriptors() and get_input_nonblocking()
   should be used instead of get_input() to allow input processing
   without blocking.

 * The Columns, Pile and ListBox widgets now choose their first
   selectable child widget as the focus widget by default.

 * New ListWalker base class for list walker classes.

 * New Signals class that will be used to improve the existing event
   callbacks. Currently it is used for ListWalker objects to notify
   their ListBox when their content has changed.

 * SimpleListWalker now behaves as a list and supports all list
   operations. This class now detects when changes are made to the list
   and notifies the ListBox object. New code should use this class to
   wrap lists of widgets before passing them to the ListBox
   constructor.

 * New PollingListWalker class is now the default list walker that is
   used when passing a simple list to the ListBox constructor. This
   class is intended for backwards compatibility only. When this class
   is used the ListBox object is unable to cache its render() method.

 * The curses_display module can now draw in the lower-right corner of
   the screen.

 * All display modules now have start() and stop() methods that may be
   used instead of calling run_wrapper().

 * The raw_display module now uses an alternate buffer so that the
   original screen can be restored on exit. The old behaviour is
   available by setting the alternate_buffer parameter of start() or
   run_wrapper() to False.

 * Many internal string processing functions have been rewritten in C to
   improve their performance.

 * Compatible with Python >= 2.2. Python 2.1 is no longer supported.


Urwid 0.9.7.2
=============

2007-01-03

 * Improved performance in UTF-8 mode when ASCII text is used.

 * Fixed a UTF-8 input bug.

 * Added a clear() function to the display modules to force the
   screen to be repainted on the next draw_screen() call.


Urwid 0.9.7.1
=============

2006-10-03

 * Fixed bugs in Padding and Overlay widgets introduced in 0.9.7.


Urwid 0.9.7
===========

2006-10-01

 * Added initial support for fixed widgets - widgets that have a fixed
   size on screen. Fixed widgets expect a size parameter equal to ().
   Fixed widgets must implement the pack(..) function to return their
   size.

 * New BigText class that draws text with fonts made of grids of
   character cells. BigText is a fixed widget and doesn't do any
   alignment or wrapping. It is intended for banners and number readouts
   that need to stand out on the screen.

   Fonts: Thin3x3Font, Thin4x3Font, Thin6x6Font (full ascii)

   UTF-8 only fonts: HalfBlock5x4Font, HalfBlock6x5Font,
   HalfBlockHeavy6x5Font, HalfBlock7x7Font (full ascii)

   New function get_all_fonts() may be used to get a list of the
   available fonts.

 * New example program bigtext.py demonstrates use of BigText.

 * Padding class now has a clipping mode that pads or clips fixed
   widgets to make them behave as flow widgets.

 * Overlay class can now accept a fixed widget as the widget to display
   "on top".

 * New Canvas functions: pad_trim() and pad_trim_left_right().

 * Fixed a bug in Filler.get_cursor_coords() that causes a crash if the
   contained widget's get_cursor_coords() function returns None.

 * Fixed a bug in Text.pack() that caused an infinite loop when the text
   contained a newline. This function is not currently used by Urwid.

 * Edit.__init__() now calls set_edit_text() to initialize its text.

 * Overlay.calculate_padding_filler() and Padding.padding_values() now
   include focus parameters.


Urwid 0.9.6
===========

2006-08-22

 * Fixed Unicode conversion and locale issues when using Urwid with
   Python < 2.4. The graph.py example program should now work properly
   with older versions of Python.

 * The docgen_tutorial.py script can now write out the tutorial example
   programs as individual files.

 * Updated reference documentation table of contents to show which
   widgets are flow and/or box widgets.

 * Columns.set_focus(..) will now accept an integer or a widget as its
   parameter.

 * Added detection for rxvt's HOME and END escape sequences.

 * Added support for setuptools (improved distutils).


Urwid 0.9.5
===========

2006-06-14

 * Some Unicode characters are now converted to use the G1 alternate
   character set with DEC special and line drawing characters. These
   Unicode characters should now "just work" in almost all terminals and
   encodings.

   When Urwid is run with the UTF-8 encoding the characters are left as
   UTF-8 and not converted.

   The characters converted are:

   \u00A3 (£), \u00B0 (°), \u00B1 (±), \u00B7 (·), \u03C0 (π),
   \u2260 (≠), \u2264 (≤), \u2265 (≥), \u23ba (⎺), \u23bb (⎻),
   \u23bc (⎼), \u23bd (⎽), \u2500 (─), \u2502 (│), \u250c (┌),
   \u2510 (┐), \u2514 (└), \u2518 (┘), \u251c (├), \u2524 (┤),
   \u252c (┬), \u2534 (┴), \u253c (┼), \u2592 (▒), \u25c6 (◆)

 * New SolidFill class for filling an area with a single character.

 * New LineBox class for wrapping widgets in a box made of line- drawing
   characters. May be used as a box widget or a flow widget.

 * New example program graph.py demonstrates use of BarGraph, LineBox,
   ProgressBar and SolidFill.

 * Pile class may now be used as a box widget and contain a mix of box
   and flow widgets.

 * Columns class may now contain a mix of box and flow widgets. The box
   widgets will take their height from the maximum height of the flow
   widgets.

 * Improved the smoothness of resizing with raw_display module. The
   module will now try to stop updating the screen when a resize event
   occurs during the update.

 * The Edit and IntEdit classes now use their set_edit_text() and
   set_edit_pos() functions when handling keypresses, so those functions
   may be overridden to catch text modification.

 * The set_state() functions in the CheckBox and RadioButton classes now
   have a do_callback parameter that determines if the callback function
   registered will be called.

 * Fixed a newly introduced incompatibility with python < 2.3.

 * Fixed a missing symbol in curses_display when python is linked
   against libcurses.

 * Fixed mouse handling bugs in the Frame and Overlay classes.

 * Fixed a Padding bug when the left or right has no padding.


Urwid 0.9.4
===========

2006-05-30

 * Enabled mouse handling across the Urwid library.

   Added a new mouse_event() method to the Widget interface definition
   and to the following widgets: Edit, CheckBox, RadioButton, Button,
   GridFlow, Padding, Filler, Overlay, Frame, Pile, Columns, BoxAdapter
   and ListBox.

   Updated example programs browse.py, calc.py, dialog.py, edit.py and
   tour.py to support mouse input.

 * Released the files used to generate the reference and tutorial
   documentation: docgen_reference.py, docgen_tutorial.py and
   tmpl_tutorial.html. The "docgen" scripts write the documentation to
   stdout. docgen_tutorial.py requires the Templayer HTML templating
   library to run: http://excess.org/templayer/

 * Improved Widget and List Walker interface documentation.

 * Fixed a bug in the handling of invalid UTF-8 data. All invalid
   characters are now replaced with '?' characters when displayed.


Urwid 0.9.3
===========

2006-05-14

 * Improved mouse reporting.

   The raw_display module now detects gpm mouse events by reading
   /usr/bin/mev output. The curses_display module already supports gpm
   directly.

   Mouse drag events are now reported by raw_display in terminals that
   provide button event tracking and on the console with gpm. Note that
   gpm may report coordinates off the screen if the user drags the mouse
   off the edge.

   Button release events now report which button was released if that
   information is available, currently only on the console with gpm.

 * Added display of raw keycodes to the input_test.py example program.

 * Fixed a text layout bug affecting clipped text with blank lines, and
   another related to wrapped text starting with a space character.

 * Fixed a Frame.keypress() bug that caused it to call keypress on
   unselectable widgets.


Urwid 0.9.2
===========

2006-03-18

 * Preliminary mouse support was added to the raw_display and
   curses_display modules. A new Screen.set_mouse_tracking() method was
   added to enable mouse tracking. Mouse events are returned alongside
   keystrokes from the Screen.get_input() method.

   The widget interface does not yet include mouse handling. This will
   be addressed in the next release.

 * A new convenience function is_mouse_event() was added to help in
   separating mouse events from keystrokes.

 * Added a new example program input_test.py. This program displays the
   keyboard and mouse input it receives. It may be run as a CGI script
   or from the command line. On the command line it defaults to using
   the curses_display module, use input_test.py raw to use the
   raw_display module instead.

 * Fixed an Edit.render() bug that caused it to render the cursor in a
   different location than that reported by Edit.get_cursor_coords() in
   some circumstances.

 * Fixed a bug preventing use of UTF-8 characters with Divider widgets.


Urwid 0.9.1
===========

2006-03-06

 * BarGraph and ProgressBar can now display data more accurately by
   using the UTF-8 vertical and horizontal eighth characters. This
   behavior will be enabled when the UTF-8 encoding is detected and
   "smoothed" attributes are passed to the BarGraph or ProgressBar
   constructors.

 * New get_encoding_mode() function to determine how Urwid will treat
   raw string data.

 * New raw_display.signal_init() and raw_display.signal_restore()
   methods that may be overridden by threaded applications that need to
   call signal.signal() from their main thread.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented the use of UTF-8 strings in text markup.

 * Removed some forgotten asserts that broke 8-bit and CJK input.


Urwid 0.9.0
===========

2006-02-18

 * New support for UTF-8 encoding including input, display and editing
   of narrow and wide (CJK) characters.

   Preliminary combining (zero-width) character support is included, but
   full support will require terminal behavior detection.

   Right-to-Left input and display are not implemented.

 * New raw_display module that handles console display without relying
   on external libraries. This module was written as a work around for
   the lack of UTF-8 support in the standard version of ncurses.

   Eliminates "dead corner" in the bottom right of the screen.

   Avoids use of bold text in xterm and gnome-terminal for improved
   text legibility.

 * Fixed Overlay bug related to UTF-8 handling.

 * Fixed Edit.move_cursor_to_coords(..) bug related to wide characters
   in UTF-8 encoding.


Urwid 0.9.0-pre3
================

2006-02-13

 * Fixed Canvas attribute padding bug related to -pre1 changes.


Urwid 0.9.0-pre2
================

2006-02-10

 * Replaced the custom align and wrap modes in example program calc.py
   with a new layout class.

 * Fixed Overlay class call to Canvas.overlay() broken by -pre1 changes.

 * Fixed Padding bug related to Canvas -pre1 changes.


Urwid 0.9.0-pre1
================

2006-02-08

 * New support for UTF-8 encoding. Unicode strings may be used and will
   be converted to the current encoding when output. Regular strings in
   the current encoding may still be used.

   PLEASE NOTE: There are issues related to displaying UTF-8 characters
   with the curses_display module that have not yet been resolved.

 * New set_encoding() function replaces util.set_double_byte_encoding().

 * New supports_unicode() function to query if unicode strings with
   characters outside the ascii range may be used with the current
   encoding.

 * New TextLayout and StandardTextLayout classes to perform text
   wrapping and alignment. Text widgets now have a layout parameter to
   allow use of custom TextLayout objects.

 * New layout structure replaces line translation structure. Layout
   structure now allows arbitrary reordering/positioning of text
   segments, inclusion of UTF-8 characters and insertion of text not
   found in the original text string.

 * Removed util.register_align_mode() and util.register_wrap_mode().
   Their functionality has been replaced by the new layout classes.


Urwid 0.8.10
============

2005-11-27

 * Expanded tutorial to cover advanced ListBox usage, custom widget
   classes and the Pile, BoxAdapter, Columns, GridFlow and Overlay
   classes.

 * Added escape sequence for "shift tab" to curses_display.

 * Added ListBox.set_focus_valign() to allow positioning of the focus
   widget within the ListBox.

 * Added WidgetWrap class for extending existing widgets without
   inheriting their complete namespace.

 * Fixed web_display/mozilla breakage from 0.8.9. Fixed crash on invalid
   locale setting. Fixed ListBox slide-back bug. Fixed improper space
   trimming in calculate_alignment(). Fixed browse.py example program
   rows bug. Fixed sum definition, use of long ints for python2.1. Fixed
   warnings with python2.1. Fixed Padding.get_pref_col() bug. Fixed
   Overlay splitting CJK characters bug.


Urwid 0.8.9
===========

2005-10-21

 * New Overlay class for drawing widgets that obscure parts of other
   widgets. May be used for drop down menus, combo boxes, overlapping
   "windows", caption text etc.

 * New BarGraph, GraphVScale and ProgressBar classes for graphical
   display of data in Urwid applications.

 * New method for configuring keyboard input timeouts and delays:
   curses_display.Screen.set_input_timeouts().

 * Fixed a ListBox.set_focus() bug.


Urwid 0.8.8
===========

2005-06-13

 * New web_display module that emulates a console display within a web
   browser window. Application must be run as a CGI script under Apache.

   Supports font/window resizing, keepalive for long-lived connections,
   limiting maximum concurrent connections, polling and connected update
   methods. Tested with Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.

 * New BoxAdapter class for using box widgets in places that usually
   expect flow widgets.

 * New curses_display input handling with better ESC key detection and
   broader escape code support.

 * Shortened resize timeout on gradual resize to improve responsiveness.


Urwid 0.8.7
===========

2005-05-21

 * New widget classes: Button, RadioButton, CheckBox.

 * New layout widget classes: Padding, GridFlow.

 * New dialog.py example program that behaves like dialog(1) command.

 * Pile widgets now support selectable items, focus changing with up and
   down keys and setting the cursor position.

 * Frame widgets now support selectable items in the header and footer.

 * Columns widgets now support fixed width and relative width columns, a
   minimum width for all columns, selectable items within columns
   containing flow widgets (already supported for box widgets), focus
   changing with left and right keys and setting the cursor position.

 * Filler widgets may now wrap box widgets and have more alignment options.

 * Updated tour.py example program to show new widget types and
   features.

 * Avoid hogging cpu on gradual window resize and fix for slow resize
   with cygwin's broken curses implementation.

 * Fixed minor CJK problem and curs_set() crash under MacOSX and Cygwin.

 * Fixed crash when deleting cells in calc.py example program.


Urwid 0.8.6
===========

2005-01-03

 * Improved support for CJK double-byte encodings: BIG5, UHC, GBK,
   GB2312, CN-GB, EUC-KR, EUC-CN, EUC-JP (JISX 0208 only) and EUC-TW
   (CNS 11643 plain 1 only)

 * Added support for ncurses' use_default_colors() function to
   curses_display module (Python >= 2.4).

   register_palette() and register_palette_entry() now accept "default"
   as foreground and/or background. If the terminal's default attributes
   cannot be detected black on light gray will be used to accommodate
   terminals with always-black cursors.

   "default" is now the default for text with no attributes. This means
   that areas with no attributes will change from light grey on black
   (curses default) to black on light gray or the terminal's default.

 * Modified examples to not use black as background of Edit widgets.

 * Fixed curses_display curs_set() call so that cursor is hidden when
   widget in focus has no cursor position.


Urwid 0.8.5
===========

2004-12-15

 * New tutorial covering basic operation of: curses_display.Screen,
   Canvas, Text, FlowWidget, Filler, BoxWidget, AttrWrap, Edit, ListBox

 * Fixed cursor in screenshots of CJK text. Fixed "end" key in Edit
   boxes with CJK text.


Urwid 0.8.3
===========

2004-11-15

 * Added support for CJK double-byte encodings.

   Word wrapping mode "space" will wrap on edges of double width
   characters. Wrapping and clipping will not split double width
   characters.

   curses_display.Screen.get_input() may now return double width
   characters. Text and Edit classes will work with a mix of regular and
   double width characters.

 * Use new method Edit.set_edit_text() instead of Edit.update_text().

 * Minor improvements to edit.py example program.
