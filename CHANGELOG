Urwid 1.1.0

    * New common container API: focus, focus_position, contents,
      options(), get_focus_path(), set_focus_path(), __getitem__,
      __iter__(), __reversed__() implemented across all included
      container widgets

      A full description doesn't fit here, see the Container Widgets
      section in the manual for details

      cases where the number of rows or columns are specified by the
      container options

    * Pile and Columns widgets now accept any iterable to their
      __init__() methods

    * Widget now has a default focus_position property that raises
      an IndexError when read to be consistent with new common container

      Scharkus)

    * Fixed an is_wide_character() segfault on bad input data bug
      (by Andrew Psaltis)
    
    * Fixed a CanvasCache with render() used in both a widget and its
      superclass bug (found by Andrew Psaltis)

    * Fixed a ListBox.ends_visible() on empty list bug (found by Marc 
      Hartstein)
    
    * Fixed a tutorial example bug (found by Kurtis D. Rader)

    * Fixed an Overlay.keypress() bug (found by Andreas Klöckner)

    * Fixed setuptools configuration (by Andreas Klöckner)


Urwid 0.9.8.3

    * Fixed a canvas cache memory leak affecting 0.9.8, 0.9.8.1 and 
      0.9.8.2 (found by John Goodfellow)

    * Fixed a canvas fill_attr() bug (found by Joern Koerner)


Urwid 0.9.8.2

    * Fixed incompatibilities with Python 2.3

    * Fixed Pile cursor pref_col bug, WidgetWrap rows caching bug, Button
      mouse_event with no callback bug, Filler body bug triggered by the
      tutorial and a LineBox lline parameter typo.


Urwid 0.9.8.1

    * Fixed a Filler render() bug, a raw_display start()/stop() bug and a
      number of problems triggered by very small terminal window sizes.


Urwid 0.9.8

    * Rendering is now significantly faster.

    * New Widget base class for all widgets. It includes automatic caching
      of rows() and render() methods. It also adds a new __super attribute
      for accessing methods in superclasses.

      Widgets must now call self._invalidate() to notify the cache when
      their content has changed.

      To disable caching in a widget set the class variable no_cache to a
      list that includes the string "render".

    * Canvas classes have been reorganized: Canvas has been renamed to
      TextCanvas and Canvas is now the base class for all canvases. New
      canvas classes include BlankCanvas, SolidCanvas and CompositeCanvas.

    * External event loops may now be used with the raw_display module. The
      new methods get_input_descriptors() and get_input_nonblocking()
      should be used instead of get_input() to allow input processing
      without blocking.

    * The Columns, Pile and ListBox widgets now choose their first
      selectable child widget as the focus widget by defaut.

    * New ListWalker base class for list walker classes.

    * New Signals class that will be used to improve the existing event
      callbacks. Currently it is used for ListWalker objects to notify
      their ListBox when their content has changed.

    * SimpleListWalker now behaves as a list and supports all list
      operations. This class now detects when changes are made to the list
      and notifies the ListBox object. New code should use this class to
      wrap lists of widgets before passing them to the ListBox 
      constructor.

    * New PollingListWalker class is now the default list walker that is
      used when passing a simple list to the ListBox constructor. This
      class is intended for backwards compatibility only. When this class
      is used the ListBox object is unable to cache its render() method.

    * The curses_display module can now draw in the lower-right corner of
      the screen.

    * All display modules now have start() and stop() methods that may be 
      used instead of calling run_wrapper().

    * The raw_display module now uses an alternate buffer so that the
      original screen can be restored on exit. The old behaviour is
      available by seting the alternate_buffer parameter of start() or
      run_wrapper() to False.

    * Many internal string processing functions have been rewritten in C to
      improve their performance.

    * Compatible with Python >= 2.2. Python 2.1 is no longer supported.


Urwid 0.9.7.2

    * Improved performance in UTF-8 mode when ASCII text is used.

    * Fixed a UTF-8 input bug.

    * Added a clear() function to the the display modules to force the
      screen to be repainted on the next draw_screen() call.


Urwid 0.9.7.1

    * Fixed bugs in Padding and Overlay widgets introduced in 0.9.7.


Urwid 0.9.7

    * Added initial support for fixed widgets - widgets that have a fixed
      size on screen. Fixed widgets expect a size parameter equal to ().
      Fixed widgets must implement the pack(..) function to return their
      size.

    * New BigText class that draws text with fonts made of grids of
      character cells. BigText is a fixed widget and doesn't do any
      alignment or wrapping. It is intended for banners and number readouts
      that need to stand out on the screen.

      Fonts: Thin3x3Font, Thin4x3Font, Thin6x6Font (full ascii)

      UTF-8 only fonts: HalfBlock5x4Font, HalfBlock6x5Font,
      HalfBlockHeavy6x5Font, HalfBlock7x7Font (full ascii)

      New function get_all_fonts() may be used to get a list of the
      available fonts.

    * New example program bigtext.py demonstrates use of BigText.

    * Padding class now has a clipping mode that pads or clips fixed
      widgets to make them behave as flow widgets.

    * Overlay class can now accept a fixed widget as the widget to display
      "on top".

    * New Canvas functions: pad_trim() and pad_trim_left_right().

    * Fixed a bug in Filler.get_cursor_coords() that causes a crash if the
      contained widget's get_cursor_coords() function returns None.

    * Fixed a bug in Text.pack() that caused an infinite loop when the text
      contained a newline. This function is not currently used by Urwid.

    * Edit.__init__() now calls set_edit_text() to initialize its text.

    * Overlay.calculate_padding_filler() and Padding.padding_values() now
      include focus parameters.


Urwid 0.9.6

    * Fixed Unicode conversion and locale issues when using Urwid with
      Python < 2.4. The graph.py example program should now work properly
      with older versions of Python.

    * The docgen_tutorial.py script can now write out the tutorial example
      programs as individual files.

    * Updated reference documentation table of contents to show which
      widgets are flow and/or box widgets.

    * Columns.set_focus(..) will now accept an integer or a widget as its
      parameter.

    * Added detection for rxvt's HOME and END escape sequences.

    * Added support for setuptools (improved distutils).


Urwid 0.9.5

    * Some Unicode characters are now converted to use the G1 alternate
      character set with DEC special and line drawing characters. These
      Unicode characters should now "just work" in almost all terminals and
      encodings.

      When Urwid is run with the UTF-8 encoding the characters are left as
      UTF-8 and not converted.

      The characters converted are:

      \u00A3 (£), \u00B0 (°), \u00B1 (±), \u00B7 (·), \u03C0 (π),
      \u2260 (≠), \u2264 (≤), \u2265 (≥), \u23ba (⎺), \u23bb (⎻),
      \u23bc (⎼), \u23bd (⎽), \u2500 (─), \u2502 (│), \u250c (┌),
      \u2510 (┐), \u2514 (└), \u2518 (┘), \u251c (├), \u2524 (┤),
      \u252c (┬), \u2534 (┴), \u253c (┼), \u2592 (▒), \u25c6 (◆)

    * New SolidFill class for filling an area with a single character.

    * New LineBox class for wrapping widgets in a box made of line- drawing
      characters. May be used as a box widget or a flow widget.

    * New example program graph.py demonstrates use of BarGraph, LineBox,
      ProgressBar and SolidFill.

    * Pile class may now be used as a box widget and contain a mix of box
      and flow widgets.

    * Columns class may now contain a mix of box and flow widgets. The box
      widgets will take their height from the maximum height of the flow
      widgets.

    * Improved the smoothness of resizing with raw_display module. The
      module will now try to stop updating the screen when a resize event
      occurs during the update.

    * The Edit and IntEdit classes now use their set_edit_text() and
      set_edit_pos() functions when handling keypresses, so those functions
      may be overridden to catch text modification.

    * The set_state() functions in the CheckBox and RadioButton classes now
      have a do_callback parameter that determines if the callback function
      registered will be called.

    * Fixed a newly introduced incompatibility with python < 2.3.

    * Fixed a missing symbol in curses_display when python is linked
      against libcurses.

    * Fixed mouse handling bugs in the Frame and Overlay classes.

    * Fixed a Padding bug when the left or right has no padding.


Urwid 0.9.4

    * Enabled mouse handling across the Urwid library.

      Added a new mouse_event() method to the Widget interface definition
      and to the following widgets: Edit, CheckBox, RadioButton, Button,
      GridFlow, Padding, Filler, Overlay, Frame, Pile, Columns, BoxAdapter
      and ListBox.

      Updated example programs browse.py, calc.py, dialog.py, edit.py and
      tour.py to support mouse input.

    * Released the files used to generate the reference and tutorial
      documentation: docgen_reference.py, docgen_tutorial.py and
      tmpl_tutorial.html. The "docgen" scripts write the documentation to
      stdout. docgen_tutorial.py requires the Templayer HTML templating
      library to run: http://excess.org/templayer/

    * Improved Widget and List Walker interface documentation.

    * Fixed a bug in the handling of invalid UTF-8 data. All invalid
      characters are now replaced with '?' characters when displayed.


Urwid 0.9.3

    * Improved mouse reporting.

      The raw_display module now detects gpm mouse events by reading
      /usr/bin/mev output. The curses_display module already supports gpm
      directly.

      Mouse drag events are now reported by raw_display in terminals that
      provide button event tracking and on the console with gpm. Note that
      gpm may report coordinates off the screen if the user drags the mouse
      off the edge.

      Button release events now report which button was released if that
      information is available, currently only on the console with gpm.

    * Added display of raw keycodes to the input_test.py example program.

    * Fixed a text layout bug affecting clipped text with blank lines, and
      another related to wrapped text starting with a space character.

    * Fixed a Frame.keypress() bug that caused it to call keypress on
      unselectable widgets.


Urwid 0.9.2

    * Preliminary mouse support was added to the raw_display and
      curses_display modules. A new Screen.set_mouse_tracking() method was
      added to enable mouse tracking. Mouse events are returned alongside
      keystrokes from the Screen.get_input() method.

      The widget interface does not yet include mouse handling. This will
      be addressed in the next release.

    * A new convenience function is_mouse_event() was added to help in
      separating mouse events from keystrokes.

    * Added a new example program input_test.py. This program displays the
      keyboard and mouse input it receives. It may be run as a CGI script
      or from the command line. On the command line it defaults to using
      the curses_display module, use input_test.py raw to use the
      raw_display module instead.

    * Fixed an Edit.render() bug that caused it to render the cursor in a
      different location than that reported by Edit.get_cursor_coords() in
      some circumstances.

    * Fixed a bug preventing use of UTF-8 characters with Divider widgets.


Urwid 0.9.1

    * BarGraph and ProgressBar can now display data more accurately by
      using the UTF-8 vertical and horizontal eighth characters. This
      behavior will be enabled when the UTF-8 encoding is detected and
      "smoothed" attributes are passed to the BarGraph or ProgressBar
      constructors.

    * New get_encoding_mode() function to determine how Urwid will treat
      raw string data.

    * New raw_display.signal_init() and raw_display.signal_restore()
      methods that may be overridden by threaded applications that need to
      call signal.signal() from their main thread.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the use of UTF-8 strings in text markup.

    * Removed some forgotten asserts that broke 8-bit and CJK input.


Urwid 0.9.0

    * New support for UTF-8 encoding including input, display and editing
      of narrow and wide (CJK) characters.

      Preliminary combining (zero-width) character support is included, but
      full support will require terminal behavior detection.

      Right-to-Left input and display are not implemented.

    * New raw_display module that handles console display without relying
      on external libraries. This module was written as a work around for
      the lack of UTF-8 support in the standard version of ncurses.

      Eliminates "dead corner" in the bottom right of the screen.

      Avoids use of bold text in xterm and gnome-terminal for improved
      text legibility.

    * Fixed Overlay bug related to UTF-8 handling.

    * Fixed Edit.move_cursor_to_coords(..) bug related to wide characters
      in UTF-8 encoding.


Urwid 0.9.0-pre3

    * Fixed Canvas attribute padding bug related to -pre1 changes.


Urwid 0.9.0-pre2

    * Replaced the custom align and wrap modes in example program calc.py
      with a new layout class.

    * Fixed Overlay class call to Canvas.overlay() broken by -pre1 changes.

    * Fixed Padding bug related to Canvas -pre1 changes.


Urwid 0.9.0-pre1

    * New support for UTF-8 encoding. Unicode strings may be used and will
      be converted to the current encoding when output. Regular strings in
      the current encoding may still be used.

      PLEASE NOTE: There are issues related to displaying UTF-8 characters
      with the curses_display module that have not yet been resolved.

    * New set_encoding() function replaces util.set_double_byte_encoding().

    * New supports_unicode() function to query if unicode strings with
      characters outside the ascii range may be used with the current
      encoding.

    * New TextLayout and StandardTextLayout classes to perform text
      wrapping and alignment. Text widgets now have a layout parameter to
      allow use of custom TextLayout objects.

    * New layout structure replaces line translation structure. Layout
      structure now allows arbitrary reordering/positioning of text
      segments, inclusion of UTF-8 characters and insertion of text not
      found in the original text string.

    * Removed util.register_align_mode() and util.register_wrap_mode().
      Their functionality has been replaced by the new layout classes.


Urwid 0.8.10

    * Expanded tutorial to cover advanced ListBox usage, custom widget
      classes and the Pile, BoxAdapter, Columns, GridFlow and Overlay
      classes.

    * Added escape sequence for "shift tab" to curses_display.

    * Added ListBox.set_focus_valign() to allow positioning of the focus
      widget within the ListBox.

    * Added WidgetWrap class for extending existing widgets without
      inheriting their complete namespace.

    * Fixed web_display/mozilla breakage from 0.8.9. Fixed crash on invalid
      locale setting. Fixed ListBox slide-back bug. Fixed improper space
      trimming in calculate_alignment(). Fixed browse.py example program
      rows bug. Fixed sum definition, use of long ints for python2.1. Fixed
      warnings with python2.1. Fixed Padding.get_pref_col() bug. Fixed
      Overlay splitting CJK characters bug.


Urwid 0.8.9

    * New Overlay class for drawing widgets that obscure parts of other
      widgets. May be used for drop down menus, combo boxes, overlapping

    * New layout widget classes: Padding, GridFlow.

    * New dialog.py example program that behaves like dialog(1) command.

    * Pile widgets now support selectable items, focus changing with up and
      down keys and setting the cursor position.

    * Frame widgets now support selectable items in the header and footer.

    * Columns widgets now support fixed width and relative width columns, a
      minimum width for all columns, selectable items within columns
      containing flow widgets (already supported for box widgets), focus
      changing with left and right keys and setting the cursor position.

Urwid 0.8.6

    * Improved support for CJK double-byte encodings: BIG5, UHC, GBK,
      GB2312, CN-GB, EUC-KR, EUC-CN, EUC-JP (JISX 0208 only) and EUC-TW
      (CNS 11643 plain 1 only)

    * Added support for ncurses' use_default_colors() function to
      curses_display module (Python >= 2.4).

      register_palette() and register_palette_entry() now accept "default"

      cannot be detected black on light gray will be used to accomodate
      terminals with always-black cursors.

      "default" is now the default for text with no attributes. This means
      that areas with no attributes will change from light grey on black
      (curses default) to black on light gray or the terminal's default.
