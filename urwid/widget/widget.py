       The default :meth:`.sizing` method returns this value.

    .. attribute:: _command_map
       :annotation: = urwid.command_map

       A shared :class:`CommandMap` instance. May be redefined in subclasses or widget instances.


    .. method:: rows(size, focus=False)

       .. note::

          This method is not implemented in :class:`.Widget` but
          must be implemented by any flow widget.  See :meth:`.sizing`.

       See :meth:`Widget.render` for parameter details.

       :returns: The number of rows required for this widget given a number of columns in *size*

       This is the method flow widgets use to communicate their size to other
       widgets without having to render a canvas. This should be a quick
       calculation as this function may be called a number of times in normal
       operation. If your implementation may take a long time you should add
       your own caching here.

       There is some metaclass magic defined in the :class:`Widget`
       metaclass :class:`WidgetMeta` that causes the
       result of this function to be retrieved from any
       canvas cached by :class:`CanvasCache`, so if your widget
       has been rendered you may not receive calls to this function. The class
       variable :attr:`ignore_focus` may be defined and set to ``True`` if this
       widget renders the same size regardless of the value of the *focus*
       parameter.

    .. method:: get_cursor_coords(size)

       .. note::

          This method is not implemented in :class:`.Widget` but
          must be implemented by any widget that may return cursor
          coordinates as part of the canvas that :meth:`render` returns.

       :param size: See :meth:`Widget.render` for details.
       :type size: widget size

       :returns: (*col*, *row*) if this widget has a cursor, ``None`` otherwise

       Return the cursor coordinates (*col*, *row*) of a cursor that will appear
       as part of the canvas rendered by this widget when in focus, or ``None``
       if no cursor is displayed.

       The :class:`ListBox` widget
       uses this method to make sure a cursor in the focus widget is not scrolled out of view.
       It is a separate method to avoid having to render the whole widget while calculating layout.

       Container widgets will typically call the :meth:`.get_cursor_coords` method on their focus widget.


    .. method:: get_pref_col(size)

       .. note::

          This method is not implemented in :class:`.Widget` but may be implemented by a subclass.

       :param size: See :meth:`Widget.render` for details.
       :type size: widget size

       :returns: a column number or ``'left'`` for the leftmost available
                 column or ``'right'`` for the rightmost available column

       Return the preferred column for the cursor to be displayed in this
       widget. This value might not be the same as the column returned from
       :meth:`get_cursor_coords`.

       The :class:`ListBox` and :class:`Pile`
       widgets call this method on a widget losing focus and use the value
       returned to call :meth:`.move_cursor_to_coords` on the widget becoming
       the focus. This allows the focus to move up and down through widgets
       while keeping the cursor in approximately the same column on screen.


    .. method:: move_cursor_to_coords(size, col, row)

       .. note::

          This method is not implemented in :class:`.Widget` but may be implemented by a subclass.
          Not implementing this method is equivalent to having a method that always returns
          ``False``.

       :param size: See :meth:`Widget.render` for details.
